<H2>Orbits around Black Holes</H2>
<HR>
The orbit of a test particle around a black hole of mass M and spin S
does not depend on the particle's mass. Rather it is
determined by the three constants of the motion E, Lz and C.
Here E is the total energy per rest mass, Lz is the z-component
of the angular momentum per rest mass and C is the Carter constant.
In order to understand these constants let's look at the Newtonian limit.
In this limit and using units where G=c=1,
we would have <P>
E = 1 + (1/2) [ (dr/dt)^2 + L^2/r^2 ] - M/r ,   <P>
where r is the distance form the center and where  <P>
L^2 = Lz^2 + C      <P>
is the total angular momentum.

Below are examples of geodesic orbits around a black hole. The black
hole is located at the center of the coordinate system.
<!--
Note that the black hole itself is not shown since it is in principle 
not visible.
