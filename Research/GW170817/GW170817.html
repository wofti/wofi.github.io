<H1>GW170817: The first detection of a gravitational wave signal due to the
merger of two neutron stars</H1>
<HR>

<P>
On August 17, 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors observed a
gravitational wave signal from two merging neutron stars for the first time.
All other detections up to then had been from merging black holes. Neutron
stars consist almost entirely of neutrons and are the densest stars known to
exist. They are so dense that a neutron star with the mass of our sun has a
size of only about 20 km. When two such stars orbit around each other they
loose energy due to the emission of gravitational waves so that the orbits
become tighter until they finally merge into one larger neutron star. When
this larger star is massive enough it collapses into a black hole. During
the collision of the stars material is ejected, so that the final merged
object is surrounded by a thick ring of neutron rich material. This material
undergoes nuclear reactions that release energy in the form of
electromagnetic radiation, an event known as kilonova. Followup observations
of the sky region where the gravitational wave signal came from with
telescopes and satellites have revealed first a Gamma Ray Burst just two
seconds after the merger, as well a new light source that emitted light of
changing frequency over the following days and weeks. This marks the first
observation of a kilonova following a gravitational wave signal. It is
believed that most heavier elements in the universe such as gold or platinum
were created in the thick rings produced by such mergers.
<P>

The numerical relativity group at FAU led by Dr. Tichy is performing
computer simulations of such merging neutron stars using Einstein's
equations of General Relativity. This work is carried out within the BAM
collaboration on Computational Relativity in close cooperation with Dr.
Bernuzzi, Dr. Bruegmann and Dr. Dietrich who lead research groups in Italy
and Germany. The BAM collaboration has very recently published a
gravitational waveform model 
(<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02969">https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02969</A>)
derived from its simulations. This new model
has been one of the tools used to analyze the signal measured by the
gravitational wave detectors. With it one can extract more information from
the observed gravitational wave signal about the poorly known material
properties of matter at the extreme densities in neutron stars.
<P>

We have performed a simulation of two neutron stars
with masses that are consistent with the newly observed event.

Besides the two stars, the movie also shows the emitted
gravitational waves in yellow, as well as the strain signal on the bottom.
This movie was released under "SELECTED IMAGES & VIDEO" on
<A HREF="http://www.ligo.org/detections/GW170817.php">www.ligo.org/detections/GW170817.php</A>
when the detection was announced by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.
As one can see a black hole surrounded by a massive ring forms at the end of
our simulation.
<P>

In order to start simulations of two neutron stars one also needs initial
conditions for the all variables involved. Computing such initial conditions
for realistic stars with spin is very complicated and has only become
possible because of research carried out in the numerical relativity group
at FAU
(

<A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5336">https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5336</A>
).


The detection of the two merging neutron stars is a tremendous achievement
that is obviously fascinating and thus has captured the news when it
was announced. However, as is usually the case in science, we can learn much
more from a discovery like this when methods developed by other scientists
such as the ones in the BAM collaboration are used to analyze the results.
