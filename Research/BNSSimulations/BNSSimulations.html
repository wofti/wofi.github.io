The picture below shows the density profiles in the orbital plane
of two merging neutron stars.

Each star has 1.35 solar masses. Both stars have a small spin
pointing along the orbital angular momentum.

The next picture shows the density profiles of two unequal merging neutron
stars in the orbital plane. The stars have baryonic masses of 2.2 and 1.0
solar masses.

This system contains stars with 1.34 and 1.25 solar masses. The primary star
is a millisecond pulsar with a rotation period of 23 ms. The rotation axis
of the primary star and the orbital angular momentum are not aligned which
leads to precession effects. The system  is constructed based on our
knowledge of PSR J0737-3039 and how it will evolve until it merges in about
85 million years.

The animation is a combination of different movies and shows inspiral and
merger of two neutron stars with 1.34 and 1.25 solar masses. The different
panels show the density (upper left), the entropy (upper right), the
gravitational wave (lower left) and the ejected material (lower right).

In addition to the visualization we add sound. The sound track is generated
by creating a sinusoidal sound with the same frequency as the
gravitational wave signal and with an amplitude varying proportional to the
gravitational wave's amplitude.
