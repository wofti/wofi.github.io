<H1>Numerical simulation of orbiting black holes</H1>


One of the fundamental problems of general relativity is the two body
problem of black holes in orbit. Since in general relativity two orbiting
bodies emit gravitational waves that carry away energy and momentum from the
system, the two black holes spiral inward and eventually merge. The last
few orbits of a black hole binary fall into the strongly dynamic and
non-linear regime of general relativity, and we therefore turn to numerical
simulations to solve the full Einstein equations. Such numerical simulations
have seen many advances in the last few years, but until recently it has not
been possible to simulate even a single binary black hole orbit.

Together with Bernd Bruegmann and Nina Jansen 
at the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry 
at Penn State University
I have developed coordinate
conditions which lead to approximately comoving coordinates. Such coordinate
systems have the advantage that the rapid orbiting motion of the two black
holes is transformed away. The fact that the two black holes do not move
with respect to these coordinates simplifies the numerical simulation and
also leads to more stable simulations. Using theses coordinates we were
able to perform the first simulation of a binary black hole system that
lasted about one orbital timescale. The
picture shows the horizons of the two black holes after they have evolved
for one orbital timescale. Note that in the coordinates used the two black
holes have not moved from their initial positions. Their horizons, however,
have been deformed during this time from coordinate spheres into an oblate
shape.
