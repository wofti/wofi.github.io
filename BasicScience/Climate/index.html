<H1>Climate</H1>

There are still people who are skeptical about whether global temperatures
are actually rising. Many of them think of themselves as independent minded
intellectuals, because they do not agree with what most other people already
know. However, in reality they are fools, because they are unable to see
basic facts.

<H2>CO2 Rise</H2>

The CO2-content of the atmosphere had been stable for a long time.
<P> 
<IMG SRC="air_bubbles_historical.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=600>
<P> 
The plots above show data from old air captured in bubbles in ice cores from
Antarctica. The top plot shows the CO2 content. Over this long time scale of
800000 years the CO2 content of our atmosphere was fluctuating between about
180 ppm and 300 ppm.
<br>
<br>
The plots below show again show data from Antarctic ice cores
as well as direct measurement during the last 50 years.

<P>
All plots show the same data, but we have successively zoomed in in time.
The first one shows about 400000 years. We see that until very recently
the CO2 content of our atmosphere was fluctuating between about 180 ppm
and 300 ppm. This only started changing in the 20th century. 
The last plot zooms in onto direct atmospheric measurements from Mauna Loa
Observatory (MLO).
Hence it is clear that, for the entire time that our species has
even existed, CO2 was never as high as today. It is thus clear that the large
amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity.

The data can be found at

<H2>Greenhouse Effect</H2>

When sunlight warms the ground, the ground will emit infrared radiation (i.e.
we feel it radiating heat). Much of this infrared radiation travels back
into space. However, some of it is absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere.
When these molecules then re-radiate this energy, they emit equally into all
directions, i.e. some part of it is radiated back down. I.e. these molecules
reduce how much heat earth radiates into space. Thus on the ground it will
be warmer than without these molecules. This is also known as the greenhouse
effect. Now, different molecules like CO2 or O2 differ in how much infrared
radiation they absorb. CO2 happens to be a quite good infrared absorber.
Thus if everything else remains the same, and only the amount of CO2 is
increased, the ground and lower atmosphere, that we live in, will get
warmer! This are indisputable facts, that have all been experimentally
verified. Anyone who doubts them is in technical terms an idiot.
<br>
Hence the only questions are now: Are there other effects that could come into
play and compensate for the warming effect from CO2? And thus, how much
warmer will it get?

<H2>Temperature Rise</H2>

Since CO2 levels are rising at unprecedented rates, the question is then 
what the global average temperature change is. Let us consider again
measurements.
<P> 
<IMG SRC="temp_CE-350y.png" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=400>
<IMG SRC="temp_CE-100y.png" ALIGN=MIDDLE width=400>
<P>

These plots show annual means for Central England, Amberg in Germany
and Wakkanai, Japan. The
Central England series is the longest in the world. As we can see there is a
warming trend since about 1950 which coincides with the steep increase in CO2
in the earlier plots. However, we can also see that there are a lot of
fluctuations. Nevertheless, all three, the temperature maxima, minima and
averages seem to have risen since 1950. The amount of the rise is about
1K (one degree Celsius) in Central England and Wakkanai, and even higher
in Amberg.
<P>

Of course, these are just measurements at three arbitrary locations. However,
one obtains qualitatively similar pictures in many places in the world. Yet
what is more important is the mean of temperature changes all over the
world. Determining this mean is a research area of its own. It is carried
out not only using weather stations all over the world, but also satellite
measurements.

This plot shows the global average temperature change from various sources. As one
can see, there is a rise of about 1K (one degree Celsius) since 1950.

<H2>Climate Change</H2>

Everything mentioned so far on this page are pretty much just indisputable
facts. The big question is now, what has caused the rising temperatures? Is
it the increased amount of CO2? Or, as some claim, are temperatures rising
on their own, and CO2 is not the reason for this rise?
<P>

The only way to answer this, is by trying to calculate how the climate
behaves under different circumstances. This means the that we have to model
the entire ocean and atmosphere of the planet. Model here means to solve
all the different physics equations that determine them. Such modeling is
not easy, and requires large scale supercomputer simulations. Unlike the facts
above, it is not a topic that can be easily explained on a webpage. Rather
it requires years of study to even begin to understand all the relevant
topics. This means most people will never understand this topic on their
own. Rather they have to believe what someone else says.
<P>

So who should we believe? Well, for sure not anyone who is not a scientist
in this area. Now, the scientists have reached consensus (i.e. the vast
majority agree with each other) that the temperature rise which we observe,
is due to the increased amount of CO2 that humans have put into the
atmosphere. Ideally that should close the case, at least until the
scientific consensus changes (which sometimes does happen in science).
Anything else would mean that we do not use the best knowledge available,
and rather base our beliefs on something that people who are ignorant of
the topic have made up.
<P>

To get an idea about the scientific consensus, you can look here:

<P>

It turns out that rising temperatures (even by a few degrees) can have
negative effects for humanity. We should thus find a way of life that avoids
further increases in atmospheric CO2, as much as possible.
