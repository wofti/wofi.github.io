There are still people who believe in stories from the dark ages.

<ol>

<li>
One such example are extreme Christians who believe the world is 
only about 6000 years old. 
This kind of nonsense is in direct contradiction
to observable facts, e.g. tree ring counts (the field is
called 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology">Dendrochronology</A>). 
Fully anchored chronologies from tree rings
now exist for more than 12000 years 
(see e.g. <A HREF="Friedrich_Dendro_RC04.pdf">Friedrich et al.</A>).
Of course there are other ways of dating
e.g. 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating">Radiocrabon dating</A>
(up to about 60000 years back), or
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core#Dating_cores">ice core dating</A>
(up to 800000 years back).

There are however yet other ways how one can see that in makes no sense
whatsoever to assume that the universe is only about 6000 old. If that were
true the furthest light source in the sky we could observe would be about
6000 lightyears away (i.e. the distance that light can travel in 6000
years). Yet our own milky way galaxy is already about ten times larger that!
This means we could not see all the stars in our galaxy, nor could we see
any other galaxies at all! This is in direct contradiction to observations
such as the many beautiful images of far away galaxies we have from the
Hubble space telescope.

<li>
Indeed there are people who believe so much in old stories that they take
the bible literally. Those people believe all plant and animals were
created by god in seven days.

They want to teach Creationism (now also often called "Intelligent Design")
in schools

There are still people who think that global temperatures are not rising,
and that the entire climate change discussion is a hoax.
