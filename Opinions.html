<h2>Why it is stupid to buy a car like the Dodge Ram</h2>

I can see that you need a ram to properly to storm a castle and smash
through its gates. And since the castle defenders then will likely hurl
rocks and missiles at you, you naturally want to dodge them, so a Dodge Ram
seems like a good solution. Even though it is clear that there are even
better vehicles these days (like tanks) for this kind of purpose, a Dodge
Ram seems like an acceptable option for the average Joe. However, there is
one fact that is totally overlooked in these considerations. How often do
you actually have to storm castles these days? For me at least it is so rare
that I hardly remember the last time. And that is why buying a Dodge Ram (or
similar car) is a stupid idea these days!!!
