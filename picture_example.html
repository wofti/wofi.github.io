<H3>PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP AWARD PROGRAM</H3>

 The President's Leadership Award Program is intended to recognize
individual employees of Florida Atlantic University who have rendered
services of an extraordinary nature to the University and/or the greater
community. Persons recognized should have played leadership roles in efforts
that delivered substantial benefits to the University as a whole, to a
community served by the University or to another external population.
Leadership can be demonstrated in many ways. In all cases, however, leaders
inspire and mobilize others to work cooperatively and effectively toward the
betterment of the University or community. Leaders are innovative and
resourceful. They have a vision of how the institution, its relationship to
the community, or the community itself, could be made better. Leaders are
willing to work hard to turn that vision into reality and they are able to
earn the support of others for their projects. Leaders go beyond their job
descriptions and exceed the typical expectations of the assignment. Leaders
make a difference.
